# Daily Streak Feature Implementation

## Overview
The Daily Streak feature has been successfully implemented in the Doubtroom application. This feature tracks user activity and maintains a daily streak counter that resets after 24 hours of inactivity.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Implementation

#### Database Schema Updates✅
- **User Model** (`backend/models/User.js`): Added streak-related fields:
  - `currentStreak`: Current daily streak count
  - `longestStreak`: Longest streak achieved
  - `lastActivityDate`: Last activity timestamp
  - `lastStreakUpdate`: Last streak update timestamp

#### API Endpoints✅
- **GET** `/api/streak`: Get user's current streak data
- **POST** `/api/streak/update`: Update user's streak (called on activity)

#### Controllers✅
- **`streakController.js`**: Handles streak logic including:
  - Daily streak calculation
  - Consecutive day tracking
  - Streak reset after inactivity
  - Longest streak tracking

#### Automated Reset Job✅-not needed
- **`streakResetJob.js`**: Scheduled job that runs every hour to reset streaks for inactive users
- Automatically resets streaks for users inactive for more than 24 hours

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### Redux State Management✅
- **`streakSlice.js`**: Manages streak state with actions:
  - `fetchStreak`: Get user's streak data
  - `updateStreak`: Update streak on activity
  - `resetStreak`: Reset streak state

#### UI Components✅
- **`StreakIcon.jsx`**: Displays streak icon with count badge
  - Shows current streak number
  - Interactive tooltip with streak details
  - Hover animations
  - Positioned near profile icon in navbar

#### Activity Tracking✅removed as it is upated in contrllers
- **`useStreakActivity.js`**: Custom hook that:
  - Automatically updates streak on page visits
  - Checks for daily activity
  - Triggers streak updates on user actions

#### Integration Points
Streak updates are triggered on:
- **Home page visits**: Daily activity check
- **Question submission**: When user posts a question
- **Answer submission**: When user posts an answer

### 3. Visual Design

#### Streak Icon
- **Location**: Next to profile icon in navbar (both desktop and mobile)
- **Design**: Circular icon with streak count badge
- **Animation**: Pulse animation for active streaks
- **Tooltip**: Shows current and longest streak on hover

#### Responsive Design
- Works on both desktop and mobile layouts
- Consistent positioning across different screen sizes

## Technical Details

### Streak Logic
1. **Daily Check**: System checks if user was active today
2. **Consecutive Days**: If user was active yesterday, increment streak
3. **Gap Detection**: If more than 1 day gap, reset streak to 1
4. **Longest Streak**: Automatically updates if current streak exceeds previous best

### Reset Mechanism
- **Scheduled Job**: Runs every hour to check for inactive users
- **24-hour Rule**: Users inactive for more than 24 hours have their streak reset
- **Database Query**: Finds users with last activity > 24 hours ago

### Activity Tracking
- **Automatic Updates**: Streak updates on key user actions
- **Daily Limits**: Only one streak update per day per user
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI updates when streak changes

## Usage

### For Users
1. **View Streak**: Hover over the streak icon in the navbar
2. **Build Streak**: Use the app daily to maintain your streak
3. **Track Progress**: See both current and longest streaks

### For Developers
1. **Add Activity Tracking**: Import `useStreakActivity` hook in new pages
2. **Manual Updates**: Call `triggerStreakUpdate()` on user actions
3. **Custom Integration**: Use streak services for custom implementations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required - uses existing database and server configuration.

### Customization Options
- **Reset Interval**: Modify `streakResetJob.js` for different reset schedules
- **Activity Types**: Add more activity triggers in the hook
- **UI Styling**: Customize `StreakIcon.jsx` for different visual designs

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Login**: User should see streak icon in navbar
2. **Activity**: Perform actions (ask question, answer) to update streak
3. **Inactivity**: Wait 24+ hours to test reset functionality
4. **Tooltip**: Hover over streak icon to see details

### Automated Testing
- Backend: API endpoints for streak operations
- Frontend: Redux state management and UI components
- Integration: End-to-end user flow testing

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Streak Rewards**: Badges or achievements for milestone streaks
2. **Social Features**: Share streaks with friends
3. **Analytics**: Detailed streak statistics and insights
4. **Notifications**: Reminders to maintain streaks
5. **Gamification**: Points or rewards for consistent activity

### Technical Enhancements
1. **Caching**: Redis caching for better performance
2. **Webhooks**: Real-time streak updates
3. **Analytics**: Detailed user activity tracking
4. **Mobile Push**: Push notifications for streak maintenance
